     "answer": "<p>For the publicly traded stock in the parent company, you can convert at any time. One reason to do it might be to capture the current relatively low price. This is effectively a measure of downside protection and you are protected on the upside by a ceiling of $0.25, which is subjecty to change for later investors. Please note that once converted, you have no price protection. The portion of your Founder’s Shares in WODI are intended to be convertible into common stock once WODI achieves a public listing. Until that time, the market for these private shares is limited***</p>"
